# UndermountainRooms
Quickly fill an empty room in Undermountain

This project violates the "Do one thing" principle as it has grown to do much
more than the description above. It generates entire dungeons with the click
of a button, adventure hooks, treasure hordes, NPC parties, complex traps.

I spend most of my D&D prep time preparing to improvise, rather than planning
fully plotted stories that will just get thrown out anyway.

This is a tool to help that.

NOTE: This is possibly the sloppiest code I've ever written. I would NEVER
write undocumented, unorganized slop for a paying customer or employer.

I only torture myself with this spaghetti. (Honestly, it's not that bad. Just lacking comments.)

## Why "Undermountain"?

This project started as a quick way to populate one of those blank, unkeyed rooms in the 2nd Edition D&D Undermoountain boxed set. It used the random dungoen tables from the 1st edition DMG to generate room contents so I didn't have to.

The program proved to be useful in generating dungeons on the fly. I soon began running games with zero prep, completely improvising the dungeons by using this application. New features were added with an eye towards that goal. A lot of the new table were either made up, or adapted from even older published material, such as the OD&D wite box set.

Now I don't DM without it, as it does a better job of generating content for my games than most published materials.
