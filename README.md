This project violates the "Do one thing" principle as it has grown to do much
more than the description above. It generates entire dungeons with the click
of a button, adventure hooks, treasure hordes, NPC parties, complex traps.

I spend most of my D&D prep time preparing to improvise, rather than planning
fully plotted stories that will just get thrown out anyway.

This is a tool to help that.

NOTE: This is possibly the sloppiest code I've ever written. I would NEVER
write undocumented, unorganized slop for a paying customer or employer.

I only torture myself with this spaghetti.
